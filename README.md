# SimFin API wrapper for Haskell

See [simfin.com](https://simfin.com/)

Pre-alpha, expect frequent breaking changes.

No SimFin+ features have been tested at all yet.

## TODO:

* Handle upgrade prompt answers
* Add shares outstanding call
* Differentiate between ticker/id missing vs. time period missing
* Expose currency in Price data
* Move tests to test suite
  * Requres making an Internal module?
* Add CI
* Add examples (with charts?)
* Add documentation
* Publish to Hackage

## Might Do

* Specialize Standard / SimFin+ data structures and results
